## STUMPTOWN Coffee Roasters W.29th

Stumptown coffee roasters is one of most popular coffee shop in New York City now. Although I am new to NYC, my friend recommended me Stumptown. Modern desgin of shop interior and perfectly polished La Marzocco machine bring my expectation high.

After waiting long line (may be it was a lunch time) I orderd Guatemala drip coffee. Unlike "regular" coffee shop, Stumptown offer Chemex pour over coffee.

Very balanced single origin coffee. I think it is typical good laten american coffee. Reminds me Costa Rica coffee.
The roasted beans are labeled with date of roast. Which is quite nice. Every serious coffee lover wants to know when it was roasted. Altough the price is bit high(one bag is not 1lb, it is 3/4lb)
