---layout: posttitle: NYC vehicle collision---##Worst location, weather and location-clusteringIn New York City, more than 200,000 motor vehicle collisions happens every year.This means about every 3min, a collision happen somewhere in NYC. To reduce collisions, we need to find targets to improve.I used NYC collision data and historical weather data to find the worst location (total number of collisions) and worst weather condition (frequency of collsion). Further I developed new method to investigate locations where are sensitive to certain weather condition.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/nyc_collision_title.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>>### Worst vehicle collision location in NYCThanks to [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us) we can access to motor vehicle collision data which is provided by NYPD.This dataset contains detailed information about collisions including: Time, Date, Location, Contributing factor, Vehicle type and number of persons injured. Now this dataset included GPS coordinates of collision location. I checked worst collision location (total number of collisions) in NYC using 595,669 collision data from July 2012 to May 2015.(data of before July 2012 is not available)####What is your guess about worst location?It's in Brooklyn. Not in Manhattan. This red pointer indicates the worst location. Check the ranking of the total number of collisions on the left blue box. This place had 476 collisions in last three years. When you check 2nd and 3rd ranking, you can see this place is exceptional.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/worst10_map.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>Here is the pictures of the worst location. The address is Flatbush Ave and Tillary Street. Something must be wrong on this intersection, and this location needs improvement.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/Flatbush_pic.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>### Worst 10 vehicle collision locations in NYCThis table shows street names of worst 10 collision locations. Some of intersections you may easily imagine high number of collision.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/worst_loc10_list.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>### Worst taxi-taxi collision locations in NYCIn this NYC collision data, we can easily identify various worst locations other than total number of vehicle collision. For example number of people injured, number of pedestrians injured and specific vehicle type collision. Among that, here I will show one interesting example. Which is the worst taxi-taxi collision location. That is Penn Station/ Madison Square Garden. This location has huge human and taxi traffic. In fact, these surrounding blocks holds all top 4 worst taxi-taxi collision locations. This is surprising and there must be some reason. My guess is that taxi pick-up and drop-off are mixed in this location. Making clear separation would improve number of collisions.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/worst_taxitaxi_pic.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>### What weather conditions have the worst collision rate in NYC?Next I checked frequency of collision in certain weather conditions. Vehicle collision data was joined with hourly NYC weather data by searching closest time point prior to each collision. Data are from [weather underground](www.wunderground.com). First I checked total number of collision grouped by weather conditions.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/total_collision_weather.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>Using the same time period (2012-2015) weather condition data I calculated frequency of collision (# of collision per hour of specific weather condition) and normalized with clear weather (as 100%). Snow is the highest collision frequency. Interestingly rain is much lower than clear condition. This may originate this collision data is about all NYC area and not about highway.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/collision_weather_norm.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>### Location clustering with collision + weatherLastly I want to share new tool, which I developed, to characterize collision locations. This analysis tool aim to identify locations where are sensitive to specific weather condition(s). If we find specific cluster of locations, these locations would have shared defects, which lead to vehicle collision in certain weather conditions. This would give us new insights about high frequency collision locations.I made a matrix for clustering analysis. Each row represents unique collision location. Columns represent weather conditions. Value (color bar in the figure) is frequency of collision in that weather condition. For example, the top row location is high rate of collision specifically in light snow. I applied machine learning algorithms to cluster these locations.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/cluster_pic1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>Here are the results. Each algorithm uses different method to cluster, but all depending on point distance. There are many interesting clusters, but for now let’s focus on these two clusters.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/cluster_pic2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>These cluster #1 and #16 locations from DBSCAN had accidents only in Heavy rain or Snow. Let’s see these locations.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/cluster_pic3.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>#### Locations sensitive to Heavy rainHere is the heavy rain cluster. These locations are multi-lane road, and my guess is higher average driving speed. From this result we can imagine that if we use collision data of highway instead of NYC the collision frequency of rain might be much higher. How about snow sensitive locations?<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/heavy_rain_cluster.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>#### Locations sensitive to SnowAbout half of snow sensitive clusters were sloping roads. You can easily imagine vehicle slide and crash into other car during snow. As seen in these two heavy-rain and snow example, this clustering method can help identify common features of weather sensitive locations. At least this method is useful to find targets to conduct further research about environmental/location factor of vehicle collision.<img src="{{ '/assets/img/collision/snow_cluster.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=“" style="width: 600px;"/>### Summary- Worst location: Flatbush Ave and Tillary Street- Worst weather: Snow especially on sloping roads- Location clustering by weather-collision data is a new method to explore collision environments
